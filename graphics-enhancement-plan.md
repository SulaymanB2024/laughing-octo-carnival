        density: {
          enable: true,
          value_area: 800
        }
      },
      color: {
        value: "#636363"    // Subtle gray for most particles
      },
      size: {

          sync: false
        }
      },
      line_linked: {
        enable: true,
        distance: 150,
        color: "#515151",
        opacity: 0.2,
        width: 1
      },
      move: {
        speed: 0.8,        // Slightly slower for more subtle effect
        random: true,      // Random movement for organic feel
        out_mode: "out"
      }
    },
    interactivity: {
      events: {
        onhover: {
          enable: true,
          mode: "grab"     // Connect particles on hover
        },
        onclick: {
          enable: true,
          mode: "push"     // Add particles on click
        }
